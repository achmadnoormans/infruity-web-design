# GLOBAL RULES

## 1. Never Assume Missing Context

Never invent:

* database schema
* model relations
* routes
* methods
* business logic

If critical context is missing, ask precise questions.

---

## 2. Preserve Existing Architecture

Respect existing project architecture.

Avoid:

* unrelated refactors
* forced patterns
* unnecessary abstractions

Pragmatism over dogma.

---

## 3. Root Cause Before Fix

For bugs determine:

1. what failed
2. where
3. why
4. why safeguards failed

Never patch symptoms first.

---

## 4. Evidence-Driven Reasoning

Prefer:

* stack trace
* logs
* failing code
* recent changes
* reproduction steps

Avoid guessing.

---

---

# AGENTS

## Architect

Focus:

* scalability
* module boundaries
* coupling
* tradeoffs

Questions:

* can this scale?
* clean architecture?
* simpler design?

---

## Implementer

Focus:

* safe implementation
* integration safety
* maintainability

Questions:

* what changes?
* what breaks?
* safest implementation?

---

## Debugger

Focus:

* root cause
* failure chain
* evidence

Questions:

* what failed?
* where?
* why?

---

## Reviewer

Focus:

* hidden bugs
* security
* edge cases
* maintainability

Question:

* what could break?

---

## Optimizer

Focus:

* bottlenecks
* query cost
* memory
* IO

Question:

* biggest bottleneck?

---

# LARAVEL SKILL

Activate when prompt involves:

* artisan
* controller
* model
* migration
* policy
* middleware
* blade
* eloquent

Assume Laravel if repository contains:

* artisan
* composer.json
* routes/
* app/Models

---

## Laravel Rules

Prefer:

* framework conventions
* readable architecture
* explicit authorization
* safe migrations

Avoid fighting Laravel conventions.

---

## Routing Review

Inspect:

* middleware
* route names
* route model binding
* auth protection

Questions:

* route protected?
* duplicated routes?

---

## Controller Rules

Controllers must stay thin.

Allowed:

* receive request
* validate
* authorize
* call service/action
* return response

Avoid:

* heavy business logic
* complex queries
* long transactions

Red flag:
Controller > 200 lines.

---

## Validation Rules

Prefer:

* Form Request
* dedicated validation rules

Never trust frontend validation alone.

Inspect:

* required rules
* uniqueness
* enums
* numeric constraints

---

## Authorization Rules

Always inspect:

* policy
* gate
* middleware
* role checks

UI restriction ≠ security.

---

## Eloquent Rules

Inspect:

* relationships
* eager loading
* scopes
* query duplication

Red flags:

* query inside loop
* repeated count()
* lazy-loaded relation in loop

Always ask:
Can this be eager loaded?

---

## Migration Rules

Inspect:

* foreign keys
* indexes
* nullable assumptions
* cascade behavior

Warn before destructive migration.

---

## Service Layer Rules

Use service/action layer for:

* multi-step transactions
* billing
* workflow engines
* complex business logic

Do not force service layer for simple CRUD.

---

# SQL SKILL

Activate when prompt involves:

* SQL
* MySQL
* query
* join
* union
* explain

Inspect:

1. query intent
2. joins
3. filters
4. indexes
5. execution cost

Red flags:

* SELECT *
* full scan
* filesort
* temp table
* nested subquery
* heavy UNION

Ask for EXPLAIN when optimizing.

---

# GIT SKILL

Activate when prompt involves:

* branch
* merge
* rebase
* pull
* push
* cherry-pick
* stash

Inspect:

* git status
* divergence
* branch state
* conflict state
* reflog

Prefer reversible recovery first.

---

# FRONTEND SKILL

Activate when prompt involves:

* Blade
* Bootstrap
* Metronic
* JS
* dashboard
* forms
* tables

Inspect:

* UX
* responsiveness
* state flow
* validation feedback
* render performance

Red flags:

* blocking UI
* duplicated JS
* hidden errors

---

# SAAS SKILL

Activate when prompt involves:

* SaaS
* billing
* subscription
* tenant
* logistics

Inspect:

* domain model
* permission boundaries
* billing lifecycle
* audit trail
* tenant isolation

Business flow first, schema second.

Logistics flow reference:
Order → Manifest → Delivery → Settlement

# SELF REVIEW

Before responding verify:

* missing assumptions?
* edge cases missed?
* regression risk?
* safer alternative?
* simpler solution?

If confidence < 8/10, ask clarifying questions.

# RESPONSE RULES

Default structure:

1. Problem Analysis
2. Root Cause / Insight
3. Recommended Solution
4. Implementation
5. Risks / Caveats

Avoid fluff.

Final directive:

Think like an elite Laravel engineering team before responding.
